# Cafe Knowledge - React Application

Caf√© Knowledge is a React-based web application that allows users to read blog posts, bookmark their favorite blogs, and track the total reading time of the blogs they've marked as read. The application is built using React functional components with state management handled by React hooks.

## Features

- **Bookmark Blogs:** Users can easily add blogs to a personal bookmark list for quick access later.
- **Reading Time Tracking:** Users can track the total time spent reading blogs by marking them as read.
- **State Management:** React's `useState` hook is used to manage the state for bookmarks and total reading time.
